# VA Lighthouse API Integration

## Provider Directory API
This seems like a minimally-complicated place to start.

### Sandbox Access
The Provider Directory API requires an API Key, so I followed this link to get one:
[Provider Directory Sandbox Access](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/provider-directory/sandbox-access)

This link takes requestor to a Request Sandbox Access form, with the following input fields:

- First name (required): Chuck
- Last name (required): Sylvester
- Email address (required): charles.sylvester@va.gov
- Organization (required): VA OIT/VHA Women's Health (contractor)
- Description: The VHA Women's Health business organization has requested an analysis and design to build a Clinical Decision Support Platform (CDSP) compatible SMART-on-FHIR application to support the management of women's health. We are in the discovery phase to deterimine which Lighthouse APIs will be in scope, but anticipate it to include the Provider Directory and Patient Health API (FHIR). Implementation will be a follow-on project.
